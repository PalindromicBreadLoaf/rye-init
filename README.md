# rye-init

rye-init is a rewrite of sysvinit in Rust hoping to be a drop-in replacement for [sysvinit](https://codeberg.org/thejessesmith/sysvinit).
The only reason this project exists is because of this video: [Arch Linux Is Adopting A Rust Based Init...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHIZTMoyIc)

If the original authors of sysvinit wish for me to take this down for any reason, then please contact me at [herbthehaircut@proton.me](mailto:herbthehaircut@proton.me) and I'll change/remove anything requested as soon as possible.

## Building
This project currently does not function in the slightest. Don't even try. Pull-requests are open if someone wants to
add a feature though.
