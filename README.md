# rye-init

ATTENTION: DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HAS MOVED TO [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/PalindromicBreadLoaf/rye-init): https://codeberg.org/PalindromicBreadLoaf/rye-init.

rye-init is a rewrite of sysvinit in Rust hoping to be a drop-in replacement for [sysvinit](https://codeberg.org/thejessesmith/sysvinit).
The only reason this project exists is because of this video: [Arch Linux Is Adopting A Rust Based Init...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHIZTMoyIc)

If the original authors of sysvinit wish for me to take this down for any reason, then please contact me at [herbthehaircut@proton.me](mailto:herbthehaircut@proton.me) and I'll change/remove anything requested as soon as possible.

## Building
This project currently does not function in the slightest. Don't even try. Pull-requests are open if someone wants to
add a feature though.

## Notes
This is mostly a project for me to learn how to write Rust proper coming from someone who is almost exclusively a C
dev. Don't expect anything crazy to come from this, and even if it does reach a working state, it'll still almost 100%
be a better idea to just use the original, battle-tested sysvinit.
